# Units
0. Interactive pipelines with GRIP.
1. Setting up the environment and basics of numpy, opencv.
    * Indexing and Slices
    * Array math
    * Loading and saving images
    * Thresholding
2. More opencv filters
    * Morphological filters, erode/dilate
    * Blur, sharpen. Intuition for the frequency domain.
    * Brightness, contrast, saturation
3. Blob detection
    * Preprocessing with filters
    * Simple blob detector or contour detector
4. Identifying shapes
    * "Fullness" as limelight calls it
    * Convex/Concave
    * Coming up with other metrics for identify odd shapes
5. YOLOv5
    * Intuition for the convolution operator
    * Detecting objects with a pretrained network
    * Retraining?
6. Stereo Matching
    * Camera imperfections
    * Stereo block matching examples
    * Correlating depth map to physical distance experimentally
7. Video streaming (?)
    * What's a codec?
    * JPEG vs H264 concepts
    * Gstreamer example app
